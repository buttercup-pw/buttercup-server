## About
Commercial password management applications are usually backed by hosted solutions. **Buttercup server** is a package designed at delivering that side of the equation, and will eventually be used to back our own hosted solution.

Keeping with the feel of the rest of the platform, this server will remain open-source and in full-support by the core libraries, meaning you won't be locked into having to pay for a hosted Buttercup archive.
